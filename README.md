 # Data-Preprocessing

## Take 1

In this project, I have explained some of the Data Preprocessing methods in a Jupyter Notebook. For the sake of easy understanding and to simplify the concepts, I have used a small sample dataset. In the real-world problem, the dataset will be more complex and huge. 

I have covered the following topics in this project:
  * **Handling Missing Data**
  * **Encoding Categorical Data**
  * **Splitting Dataset**
  * **Feature Scaling**

To see the project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook: ["Data Preprocessing.ipynb"](https://github.com/Meghana-Meghana/Data-Preprocessing/blob/7442035fc25b3ec11ba49b595fbef649a962cd62/Take%201/Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb) 




*P.S. I will continue to update this folder with further Data Preprocessing methods.*
